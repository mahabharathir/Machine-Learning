## 📂 Project Structure

### 1. Linear Regression
- [Single Variable](./LinearRegression/SingleVariable)  
  Predict target using one input feature (e.g., house price vs size).  
- [Multiple Variable](./LinearRegression/MultipleVariable)  
  Predict target using multiple features (e.g., house price vs size, location, number of rooms).

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📌 Next Steps
- Add Logistic Regression
- Add Decision Trees
- Add Neural Networks (basic)
