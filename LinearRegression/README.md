# Linear Regression ðŸ“ˆ

Linear Regression is one of the most fundamental algorithms in Machine Learning.  
It tries to fit a straight line through the data to make predictions.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects

### 1. [Single Variable Regression](./SingleVariable)
- Predicts house price based on a single feature (e.g., house size).  
- Implements gradient descent from scratch.  
- Includes visualization of the regression line vs data points.  

### 2. [Multiple Variable Regression](./MultipleVariable)
- Predicts house price using multiple features (e.g., size, number of rooms, location index).  
- Compares implementation from scratch vs scikit-learn.  
- Shows impact of feature scaling.
